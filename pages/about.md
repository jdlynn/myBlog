This website is an attempt to learn more about web development, to capture useful information for myself or others and to have a presence on the web.  I will use Bootstrap 5 to style my site, Eleventy to generate the site and Netlify to host the finished website.  I plan to create blog entries documenting this process.  This is a work in progress and most likely will be modified as I learn more.

### About Jim
I (Jim) have been working with software since 1974 and have never lost my  passion for software development.  I first learned BASIC programming when I was a senior in high school.  I loved software development so much that I finished a degree in MIS and made it a 40 year career.  Now I develop only as a hobby to keep me mentally challenged.
