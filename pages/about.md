##### This website is an attempt to:
  * Learn more about web development. 
  * Capture useful information for myself or others.
  * Have a presence on the web.  

I used Bootstrap 5 to style my site, Eleventy to generate the site and Netlify to host the finished website.  I will create blog entries, documenting this process.  This is a work in progress and will most likely be modified as I learn more.

### About Jim
I (Jim) have been working with software since 1974 and have never lost my  passion for software development. I first learned BASIC programming when I was a senior in high school.  I loved software development so much that I completed a degree in MIS and made it a 40 year career.  Now I develop only as a hobby to keep me mentally challenged.
